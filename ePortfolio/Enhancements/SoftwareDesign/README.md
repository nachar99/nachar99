# Software Design Enhancement

## Overview

This enhancement focused on restructuring the **Travlr Getaways** application from a static website into a full **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture.  
The goal was to make the codebase more organized, modular, and scalable while improving the user interface and navigation experience.

## Core Enhancements

- Converted all static HTML pages into **Handlebars (HBS)** templates for dynamic rendering.
- Created dedicated **controllers** to handle route logic and data flow between the frontend and backend.
- Implemented a consistent **layout** across Home, About, and Trips pages.
- Added global error handling and middleware setup in `server.js`.
- Applied **Helmet**, **CORS**, and custom error pages to strengthen structure and reliability.

## Skills Demonstrated

- MVC architecture design
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Modular route and controller management
- Front-end consistency and UI structuring

## Tools & Technologies

Node.js · Express.js · Handlebars · Helmet · CORS · JavaScript · CSS
