# Algorithms & Data Structures Enhancement

## Overview

This enhancement improved the **backend performance** of the Travlr Getaways app by introducing **sorting, filtering, and pagination**  
to optimize how data is retrieved from MongoDB. The goal was to enhance query efficiency and scalability while improving user interaction.

## Core Enhancements

- Added **query-based filtering** (e.g., destination, price, date).
- Implemented **sorting** by various fields like price or start date.
- Introduced **pagination** .
- Updated controller logic to dynamically respond to user queries.
- Integrated front-end controls for filters and navigation between pages.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data retrieval optimization
- Efficient algorithm design for querying
- Backend scalability and user-focused design
- Integration between backend logic and SSR views

## Tools & Technologies

Node.js · Express.js · MongoDB · Mongoose · Postman · JavaScript
