        <p>
          This ePortfolio brings together the work I’ve done throughout the
          Computer Science program and really shows how far I’ve come as a
          developer. The Travlr Getaways app started as a basic class project,
          but through the enhancements I made, it turned into a professional
          full-stack web application. Each upgrade taught me something new about
          how to design, optimize, and secure software systems. The three major
          areas I focused on Software Design & Engineering, Algorithms & Data
          Structures, and Databases & Security helped me make the app better.

            <h3>1) Software Design & Engineering</h3>
            <p>
              For the first enhancement, I focused on improving the project’s
              structure and organization. The original codebase had very little
              structure, so I refactored it using a proper Model-View-Controller
              (MVC) pattern. I added Helmet and CORS for better security, dotenv
              for environment configuration, and global error handling to
              improve reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the front-end, I replaced static HTML with dynamic Handlebars
              (HBS) templates to make it modern and responsive. These changes
              made the project cleaner, easier to maintain, and visually
              consistent, directly aligning with Course Outcome 2, which focuses
              on professional-quality communication through design and
              functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Impact:</em> The project moved from looking like a student
              demo to something a real travel company could use.

              The second enhancement was about performance and efficiency. I
              upgraded the backend logic to include pagination, filtering, and
              sorting, which made the app handle larger sets of data more
              efficiently. I used MongoDB query operators and indexes to
              optimize performance, so the system only returned relevant data
              instead of overloading the response.
            </p>
            <p>
              This improved both speed and scalability while also giving users
              more control over how they interact with trip data. These updates
              align with Course Outcome 3, designing and evaluating computing
              solutions through algorithmic principles, and Course Outcome 4,
              applying innovative tools to improve performance.

              The third enhancement focused on protecting user data and securing
              system access. I added a full JWT-based authentication system with
              bcrypt password hashing to secure user logins. I also implemented
              role-based access control (RBAC) so that only admins can create,
              edit, or delete trips.The third enhancement focused on protecting

            </p>
            <p>
              To go even further, I added rate limiting to prevent brute-force
              attacks and validated all incoming data to prevent injection and
              misuse. This enhancement ties directly to Course Outcome 5, which
              focuses on developing a strong security mindset and protecting
              data through proactive design.

        <p>
          All three enhancements build on each other and show my growth as a
          full-stack developer: Software Design & Engineering improved
          structure, layout, and usability; Algorithms & Data Structures made
          backend logic efficient and scalable; and Databases & Security locked
          everything down for real world use. Together they create a solution
          that’s secure, organized, and user-friendly, covering all five
          outcomes: collaboration, communication, algorithmic problem solving,
          innovation, and security.

        <ul class="outcomes">
          <li>
            <strong>Collaborative Environments (Outcome 1):</strong> I kept the
            code clean, modular, and documented with clear commits, docs, and
            tests making it easy for others to join and maintain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Professional Communication (Outcome 2):</strong> From the
            ePortfolio to READMEs and UI, I presented work clearly for both
            technical and non-technical audiences with visuals and explanations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Algorithmic Problem Solving (Outcome 3):</strong>
            Pagination, sorting, and filtering solved real performance issues
            and showed practical use of computing principles and trade-offs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Innovative Tools & Techniques (Outcome 4):</strong>
            CSS, Express middleware, and MongoDB indexing delivered measurable
            value and followed current industry practices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security Mindset (Outcome 5):</strong> Authentication,
            password hashing, and access control demonstrate proactive risk
            thinking and data protection from the start.

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="h">Reflection & Professional Outlook</h2>
        <p>
          Completing this capstone let me apply what I’ve learned in a real
          development context. I’m confident across the stack from interfaces
          with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, to APIs with Node.js/Express, to MongoDB
          with security via JWT, bcrypt, and middleware. More importantly, I
          learned to think like a developer: break down problems, plan
          enhancements, test carefully, and communicate through code and
          documentation. The Travlr Getaways project represents everything I’ve
          learned and stands as proof of what I can build.
